            <h2> The highschoool I want to go to.</h2>
            <p> 
                I want to go to Millikan high school and have decided this recently. 
                The high school has one main program that I am interested in Quest. 
                The program will challenge me with at least 5 AP classes and will help me excel in my learning abilities. 
                I feel that this high school will give me a good experience and will help me learn, grow, and mature. 
                It has good test scores and is definitely my first option for where I want to go.Another highschool that I kept in mind was McBride high school. 
                This high school has a good program for criminal justice and I have visited the program and enjoyed it. The program will help me pursue 
                my future career which you will you will read about later. This high school is my second choice but I will keep it in mind for my top 3 choices.

                <h2>Career Interests</h2>
                <p> 
                    I am interested in some type of criminal justice and law enforcement jobs. I find that many areas do not have fair of equal systems and not all people are treated equally and deserve a say.
                    Being in law enforcement especially detectives lets me investigate crimes such as homicide cases. Although the job can be extremely dangerous I like to investigate and get down 
                    to the truth using evidence and other things.I know that this job requires a lot of hard work and skills but I am willing to work towards my goal and prove that women 
                    can be as strong and even stronger than the men.

            <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>
                        One of my main goal is to maintain a 4.0 for all of my middle school years. 
                        I have kept this score for 2 years now and have to keep it for my last year. I also want to attend a good and academic high school to help me exceed as a scholar.
                        I would like to go to an excellent college that will challenge my learning abilities and keep me on my toes at all times.
