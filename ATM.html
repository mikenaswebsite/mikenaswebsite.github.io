        <h1>Video Production Reflection</h1>
            <p>This unit has been filled with fun projects that have really expanded my learning about films.
                By using IMovie I was able to edit films like I never have before. This was very new to me and 
                I was able to use techniques that helped make my film look very professional. When I first
                went into garage band it looked like a bunch of scary buttons, but now as I use it I can explain
                a lot of them. It was fun and challenging learning about music because you want all the sounds to 
                match up perfectly. My class also took a cartoon and put background music and sound effects into it. 
                This was really amazing to see the film come more and more to life as more music and effects were added
                to the scenes.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>     ATM is a fun program that helps you evolve with technology.
        With technology growing and advancing rapidly it is important to be able to keep up and understand everything going on.
        The ATM program with helped me out so much in other classes and outside of school. I did not realize how much I didnâ€™t 
        know about computers until I came to this program. ATM has helped me in so many different ways and I am excited to see what it brings for me in the future.
