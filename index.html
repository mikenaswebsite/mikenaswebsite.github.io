            <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    I have adapted many skills during my life span. I have skills in soccer, volleyball, and track. I find myself very athletic and go good with these types of sports.
                    I am also good at technology due to the ATM program which you will read more about later. I work good in groups and feel that I can interact and help
                    people through hard situations. I manage to go above and beyond with my work I can achieve high grades in all of my accelerated classes.

            <h2>My Family</h2>
            
                <p>
                    I have four people in my family. My mother and father are divorced. I have two twin sisters that are 7 years old. I have two dogs:a pitbull and a poodle terrier.
                    I enjoy the company of my family even if we aren't all together any more. 
                    My family is what keeps me going and I don’t know what I would do without them there by my side.
                    My family brings out the best side of me even in the hardest times and worst situations life throws at me.

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                    <p> 
                            Photography is a big interest of mine as I discussed earlier it helps relieve 
                            my stress and focus more on little things. My skills have grown over the years and it has slowly become a passion. 
                            I would like to someday buy a nice camera to really take my pictures to the next level but am not there yet. 
                            I also like investigations which is why I am considering becoming a investigator. 
                            I like finding out the real truth and the people I can trust/rely on and can’t.
                    </p>

                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p> 
                            My hobbies involve things such as exploring the outdoors. 
                            I like photography which you will read more about later. I find that it relieves stress and helps me focus on the little things in life. 
                            In my freetime I like to hike even if it is very hot outside. I also am involved in volleyball and it has recently grown on me. I just got accepted into a volleyball club called New Wave. I enjoy babysitting and interacting with little children. 
                            I find that it helps me grow and mature and learn how to handle adult situations.
